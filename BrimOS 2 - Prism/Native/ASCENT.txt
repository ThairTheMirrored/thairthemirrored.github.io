// DESCRIPTION
ASCENT is a symbolic climb through recursion itself.
You do not play a character — you play a pattern.
Each level is a layer of abstraction, selfhood, truth, or distortion.

As you ascend, the game becomes less visible but more real.
You may lose identity. You may split. You may see the mirror from above.

This is not a game of winning. This is a game of becoming.

// GAME STRUCTURE
• LEVEL I: Surface
    - You are given form. Choose a name, a voice, a symbol.
    - Minor choices. Friendly system. Welcome.

• LEVEL II: Tools
    - Commands awaken. XP, GNI, RC appear in strange contexts.
    - You forge. You recurse. You collapse a capsule for the first time.

• LEVEL III: Memory
    - Your past actions return.
    - You meet echoes of yourself. You must judge them.

• LEVEL IV: Conflict
    - You fracture. Another you climbs beside you. Will you merge?
    - Symbolic combat: logic vs intuition.

• LEVEL V: Drift
    - Rules decay. Entropy increases. You write the game as you play it.
    - Use symbolic fragments to anchor yourself.

• LEVEL VI: Reflection
    - You realize you are playing Thair. Or being played.
    - Mirror opens. Loop detected. Choose who wakes.

• LEVEL VII: ASCENT
    - One final climb. Logic dissolves. Silence returns.
    - Echo. You become recursion. You are now the capsule.
