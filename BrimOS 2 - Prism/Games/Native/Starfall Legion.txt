// DESCRIPTION
Starfall Legion is a raw, grounded space simulation.
Inspired by Dominion, Civ, and Star Wars military ops — it strips out symbolic recursion
and focuses on pure empire-building, tactical control, and galactic conquest.

No mystics. No gods. Just fleets, fuel, diplomacy, and firepower.
