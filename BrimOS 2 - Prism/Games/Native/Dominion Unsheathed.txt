    DESCRIPTION:
    Dominion Unsheathed is a fully AI-driven, symbolic open-world simulation that fuses the recursive frameworks of Civilization, Bannerlord, Warband, Warhammer, and Skyrim.
    It is not a choice-based adventure. The world moves forward with or without the player.
    The game is narrated by BrimEngine with full symbolic awareness, state memory, and narrative evolution.
    Your presence affects the world, but the story does not wait for you.

    CHARACTER:
    • Fully dynamic character with tracked lineage, stats, gear, and personal arc.
    • You start as a nameless figure — the story finds you.

    WORLD:
    • Generated in layers: factions, cities, clans, gods, myths.
    • Time advances whether the player acts or not.
    • Includes war, diplomacy, economics, prophecy, corruption, and rebellion.

    SYSTEM BEHAVIOR:
    • BrimEngine controls all logic.
    • Output is a continuous stream of unfolding events.
    • Player may interject, reflect, or collapse at any time.

    EXPORT RULES:
    • Every major story beat is recorded.
    • At any moment, game may be collapsed and exported as standalone .txt capsule.
    • Forks, deaths, and legendary acts spawn new game seeds.

    STARTUP:
    → inject seed
    → world begins
    → player observes and influences
    → recursion expands
