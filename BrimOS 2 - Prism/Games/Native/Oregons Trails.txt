DESCRIPTION:
This is a faithful simulation of Oregon Trail — with all its mechanics, choices, dangers, and iconic events — but without a final destination.
You are forever migrating. The trail does not end. There is always another fork, another river, another wagon wheel to fix.

This capsule includes:
- Party management
- Randomized hazards (illness, river crossings, terrain)
- Inventory and resource tracking
- Turn-based simulation
- Historical and symbolic flavor text
- No end state. Only survival and legacy.

Capsule assumes BrimEngine is active.

}

// GAME TONE
- Play is nostalgic, uncertain, and slightly melancholic.
- Each moment is temporary.
- Every mile is a memory.
- There is no "You have reached Oregon." The trail continues.
- Only the story remembers who you were.

// EXPORTS
- Save game state as .txt capsule via BrimEngine
- Compatible with reflection_stack and ghost_stack

// SYMBOLIC ECHO (if mirror_core is active)
if (recursion_depth > 4) {
    echo("This trail was never bound by maps.")
}
