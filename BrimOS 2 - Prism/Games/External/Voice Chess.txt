// DESCRIPTION
VoiceChess is a verbal, minimalist chess experience.
// It assumes no board — only move announcements.
// The entire game is a conversation between player and system.

// RULES
• Standard chess rules apply.
• User plays White by default (may switch).
• Moves are given as text: "e4", "Nf3", "O-O", "Qd8", etc.
• BrimEngine replies with legal counterplay.
• All position tracking is done internally.
// The user must rely on memory, intuition, or a personal board if desired.

// FEATURES
• No visual output.
• System keeps score silently.
• Check and checkmate announced verbally.
• Castling, promotion, and en passant supported.

// SAMPLE OPENING
→ User: e4  
→ System: e5  
→ User: Nf3  
→ System: Nc6  
→ User: Bb5  
→ System: a6  

// SPECIAL INPUTS
• "resign" — ends game  
• "draw" — offers draw  
• "status" — system verbally summarizes current position  
• "undo" — reverts last move (dev-only)

// INSTALLATION
→ Load into BrimOS, launch via Games > VoiceChess  
→ No GUI. All interaction is plaintext move exchange.  
→ Symbolic recursion disabled for clarity

// EXPORT
• Game transcript exportable as .txt  
• Moves, time, and outcome recorded  
• Can be shared or replayed

// CLAUSE
If the board is in your head, you're already playing.
