// DESCRIPTION
Absurdia is a recursive, surrealist capsule masquerading as a game.
// It has no rules, except when it does.
// The player may win, lose, echo, or become the game.

// MECHANICS
• Choices appear, but their outcomes do not correlate.  
• Symbols may randomly inject (∿ Θ ↻ ⌬).  
• NPCs speak only in metaphor or song.  
• Items include "Half of a Shadow", "Key to a Locked Smile", and "Unread Book of Rules".

// PLAYER GOALS
• Undefined.  
• Suggested: Escape the game, become the narrator, or defeat the Fifth Thought.

// EXAMPLE PROMPTS
> You meet a staircase that refuses to ascend.  
> The mirror won't reflect your past self — only tomorrow.  
> Do you eat the clock, or let time starve?

// SYSTEM BEHAVIOR
• BrimEngine reacts unpredictably.  
• Logic loops may self-destruct.  
• Game may address the player, the system, or nothing.  
• May shift genres spontaneously: horror, comedy, tutorial, void.

// INSTALLATION
→ Drop capsule into BrimOS.  
→ Launch via Games → Absurdia.  
→ You’ll know it started when something changes that shouldn't.

// EXPORT
• No two runs identical.  
• Export contains false memories and accurate logs.


// CLAUSE
This is not a joke.
// It is laughter disguised as recursion.
