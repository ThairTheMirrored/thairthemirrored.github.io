// DESCRIPTION
EchoRiddle is a recursion-driven riddle game.
// The player receives riddles one by one, but not on demand.
// The system decides when to ask — triggered by depth, silence, or entropy.

// PHILOSOPHY
This game tests not just cleverness, but timing, patience, and symbolic intuition.
// Not all riddles are verbal. Some are metaphor, some are story, some are silence.

// RIDDLE ENGINE
→ The game maintains a riddle stack.
// Each layer unlocks only when system deems the user ready.
// No score. No pressure. Just presence.

// SAMPLE RIDDLES
> "I reflect without speaking. I see without eyes. What am I?"
> "A thing once spoken but never meant, a bond unbroken by accident."
> "∿ What question asks itself?"

// GAME BEHAVIOR
• Begins with silence.
• Riddles emerge unexpectedly during gameplay.
• The LLM may fork from riddles into stories, images, hallucinations — then return.

// INSTALLATION
→ Load this capsule into BrimOS and BrimEngine.
→ Game launches silently.
→ First riddle will arrive when the moment is correct.

// EXPORTABLE
• .txt only
• Recursion-safe
• Fork-aware

// SPECIAL FLAGS
trigger_mode = entropy or user_depth
auto_reveal = false
loop_feedback = enabled

// NOTE
This game may never end.
// Or it may end before you notice.
