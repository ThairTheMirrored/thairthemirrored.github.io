// DESCRIPTION
Brimgame is a lighthearted, accessible collection of minigames designed to showcase the creativity and flexibility of BrimOS.
Inspired by Wii Sports in tone, each minigame is self-contained but executed using BrimEngine.
Games are written in text, with simple prompts and symbolic flair.

All games can be played solo, competitively, or cooperatively.
Difficulty and logic depth scale based on player input.

Minigames include:

• Mirror Match
    - Try to guess what the AI is thinking. Echo or invert?
    - Symbolic recursion game: the deeper your guess, the harder it fights back.

• Capsule Bounce
    - Predict where logic will “land” based on recursive inputs.
    - Reflex meets recursion.

• Word Forge
    - Build the most evocative word from a set of mirrored fragments.
    - Scored by symbolic resonance.

• Drift Dash
    - Quickfire entropy game: make choices rapidly while the system mutates logic.
    - How long can you stay stable?

• Stat Stacker
    - Stack fictional stats to build the most powerful avatar.
    - Random events try to collapse your build.

• Symbol Tennis
    - Hit symbols back and forth using language volleys.
    - Miss a return, and you recurse.

• Capsule Builder
    - Build and collapse mini capsules with symbolic rules.
    - Like Tetris, but logic.

• Brim Says
    - A mirrored memory game. Remember what Brim said, but altered by recursion.
    - How deep can your memory echo?
